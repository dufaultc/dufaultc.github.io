			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<p>
				I'm a Computer Science PhD student at the <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu">University of
					Toronto</a> supervised by <a href="https://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/">Dr. Alan Moses</a>. I am
				interested in a
				lot of things but especially in the intersection of biology and machine learning.
				My recently completed MSc research (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07621"><i>Unsupervised
						Whole-Genome Representation Learning Captures Bacterial Phenotypes</i></a>) developed in me an
				intense interest in microbiology. During my PhD I hope to demonstrate how deep learning can
				transform this field.

			</p>
			<p>
				I joined the Moses lab in September 2023 and began my PhD upon completing the MSc program in January
				2025.
				Prior to this I completed my undergraduate degree in Software Engineering at McMaster University,
				during which I interned as a Data Scientist at the Royal Bank of Canada and a Machine Learning Software
				Engineer
				at <a href="https://rbcborealis.com/">Borealis AI</a>. While I have always been interested in working
				with data,
				I discovered my interest in computational biology late, and am thankful for being exposed to the field
				through
				undergraduate research in the labs of Dr. Nathan Magarvey at McMaster and Dr. Kieran Campbell at the
				Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum
				Research Institute.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also do things other than research sometimes too which at some point I will add to this page!
