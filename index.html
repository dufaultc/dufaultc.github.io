					<h4>Materials Engineering Machine Learning Challenge</h4>
					<p>I completed this project as a member of a team of four at Delthacks V,
						January 26-27 2019. I had recently become interested in Data Science and
						 was looking to apply some of my new skills. The goal of the challenge
					   was to develop a system for recognizing what fractions of an image of a
						 cross-section of a material are of what type.<br>I solved the problem
					  first using Jupyter Notebook. My group members read in the pixel data
						from the training images, which I placed into a Pandas dataframe. I then
						 created features using the RGB data about the
						 pixels in the surrounding area of each pixel. I conditioned the features with Label
					 and One-Hot Encoding, before performing a train-test split and fitting the
				 	data with a Logistic Regression Model from the Scikit-Learn Library. After
				 validating the accuracy of the model, my group transformed the concept proven
			 in the Jupyter Notebook into an application using the PySimpleGUI library as
			 well as Pickles and Pillow. We also attempted to improve the model further
		 	by creating and manipulating more features. In the end we were able to achieve
		an accuracy of ~98% in predicting the fractions of inputted images.<br> The application
	and more explanation of the challenge can be found 	<a href="https://github.com/dufaultc/MaterialsMachineLearning">here. </a></p>
